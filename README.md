## Usage

The Market Pulse EA automatically executes trades based on the breakout levels calculated from the previous candle. Here's how it works:

1. The EA initializes by setting up the desired symbol and timeframe for trading.
2. On each tick, the EA checks if there are any open trades. If not, it proceeds to the next steps.
3. The EA calculates the breakout levels by adding and subtracting the stop loss value from the previous candle's high and low.
4. If the current price crosses the upper level, a buy order is placed.
5. If the current price crosses the lower level, a sell order is placed.
6. Once a trade is opened, the EA continuously monitors the price.
7. If a buy order reaches the take profit level (OrderOpenPrice() + TakeProfit * Point), it is closed.
8. If a sell order reaches the take profit level (OrderOpenPrice() - TakeProfit * Point), it is closed.
9. The EA repeats this process for each tick.
